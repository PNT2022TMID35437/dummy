Initializing Normal-Effort Timing-Driven Placement ...
Warning:   Layout was invoked with the Timing-Driven option, but the placer was not able to find any timing-constrained paths.
                      The placer has reverted to wirelength-only placement; check whether the desired timing constraints have been entered and enabled for Layout.
